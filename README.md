# System-Administration-Scripts-Linux
Simple scripts for system administration (Unix), later I will create another one with Powershell also for Active Directory.  In this repository there are scripts for:
- Backups
- System cleanup (deleting temporary files and old logs, etc)
- Disk size monitoring tool, with personalized email notification.
- Script to detect running machines on a network segment.
- A script to organize the different files in subfolders.
- To detect which ports in your local network are open.
- A script for mass file renaming, applying a specific pattern.
- Password generator, this generator can create passwords of different security levels and display them on screen or dump them to a file.
- A duplicate file finder, this script finds and displays duplicate files in a specific directory, allowing the user to choose what to do with them.
- System event notifier, this script monitors certain events, such as reboots, logins, important file changes, and sends notifications by e-mail.
- Script to track changes in files, this script logs the changes made.

Some of these scripts can be automated to run as tasks by using the cron command and entering the time and each time you want to run the script.

Later I will make one focused for Windows systems with Powershell. Any suggestions for improvement are welcome.
